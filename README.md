# react-redux-starter-kit
React Redux Starter Kit is a simple starter kit that can be deployed to run on Amazon S3 or other cloud file storage systems.
Its a very solid starting point for creating a powerful, flexible and maintainable react website.

The main principles around this starter kit are:
* Easy and cheap deployment to cloud file storage (eg. S3) - **WILL NEVER REQUIRE A NODE SERVER TO RUN!**
* Small bundle size, only contains what you need
* Tries to be as unopinionated as possible when it comes to the tech stack
* Only contains libraries that are actively maintained
* Great dev tools to speed up development time and help maintainability

## Quick Start

todo

## Run Dev Server

You can run a local webserver during development:

```shell
$ npm start
```

## Build

This will bundle and copy files to the *build* folder:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

By default, it builds in *debug* mode. If you need to build in release
mode, run the command below. This will optimize the output bundle for
production:

```shell
$ npm run build:prod
```

## Deploy to S3

To deploy to S3 you need to make sure you have the [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) installed.
After the cli is setup and you have created a build, you can simply run:

```shell
$ npm run deploy:s3
```

Which will upload to your S3 bucket.
Make sure you modify the package.json `deploy:s3` script to ensure it has your own bucket configured.

## Test

todo

## Linting

`eslint` and `stylelint` are included in this starter kit to lint JavaScript and CSS styles.
To lint both run:

```shell
$ npm run lint
```

Or you can run them seperately:

```shell
$ npm run eslint
```

```shell
$ npm run stylelint
```

## Todo

- add unit tests
- add e2e tests
- add deployment scripts
- clean up paths
- add 1 more redux example to combine reducers
- add dev, qa, prod specific config
- remove the WATCH env?
