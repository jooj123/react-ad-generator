# react-redux-starter-kit
React Redux Starter Kit is a simple starter kit that can be deployed to run on Amazon S3 or other cloud file storage systems.

The main principles around this starter kit are:
* Easy and cheap deployment to cloud file storage (eg. S3) - WILL NEVER REQUIRE A NODE SERVER!
* Small bundle size, only contains what you need
* Tries to be as unopinionated as possible when it comes to the tech stack
* Only contains libraries that are actively maintained
* Great dev tools to speed up development time and help maintainability

This is currently in development.
Stay tuned - please star in the meantime :)
